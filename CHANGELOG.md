# Changelog

All notable changes to `flintshot` are recorded here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Version `0.x.y` is in effect during development — no API stability
guarantees until `1.0.0` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`).

Categories used below:

- **Added** — new features, crates, subcommands, public types
- **Changed** — changes to existing functionality
- **Deprecated** — soon-to-be-removed features
- **Removed** — removed features
- **Fixed** — bug fixes
- **Security** — vulnerability fixes

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Workspace scaffolding with four crates: `flintshot-app` (bin, default),
  `flintshot-core` (lib), `flintshot-editor-egui` (lib),
  `flintshot-cosmic` (bin, opt-in).
- `flintshot` CLI surface (`clap`) with subcommands `daemon`, `region`,
  `fullscreen`, `pin`, `upload` — all stubs, tagged with their target
  phase in `--help`.
- `flintshot-core` public API: geometry types (`Point`, `Rect`, `Color`,
  `Stroke`, `Key`), `Annotation` enum, `EditorState`, `Tool`, `BlurKind`,
  the `Canvas` and `EditorShell` traits, and the `UploadBackend` trait
  with supporting types (`ImageMime`, `UploadContext`, `UploadOutcome`,
  `UploadError`).
- `flintshot-core::config`: `Config`, `UiConfig`, `CaptureConfig` types
  with `Config::load()` / `Config::save()` reading and writing
  `<config_dir>/flintshot/config.toml`. Comment-preserving writes via
  `toml_edit`; partial files fall back to documented defaults.
- `flintshot-core::serde_util::color_hex` — `Color` now serializes as
  `#rrggbb` (opaque) or `#rrggbbaa` (with alpha) everywhere it appears
  (config, IPC, annotations). Reading accepts both forms with optional
  leading `#`, any case.
- New `FlintshotError::Config { path, detail }` variant for config
  parse / serialize failures.
- Hidden throwaway `flintshot --dump-config` flag that prints the
  resolved TOML (removed in Phase 1 Task 3 when the real `config`
  subcommand lands).
- Shared error types: `FlintshotError`, `Result` (libs); `color_eyre`
  reporting init in the binary.
- `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` initialized from
  `RUST_LOG`/`EnvFilter`.
- Integration test pinning the boundary: no GUI toolkit types in
  `flintshot-core`'s public API
  (`crates/flintshot-core/tests/no_gui_types_in_core.rs`).
- CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `fmt --check`, `clippy
  -D warnings`, `cargo test`, MSRV (1.95) build, opt-in
  `flintshot-cosmic` build job.
- Project documentation: `README.md`, `docs/VISION.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`
  (ADRs 0001–0012), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`.
- Dual licensing: `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, with both license files in the
  repo root and the `license` field on every crate.

### Changed

- `Color` (de)serialization switched from struct-of-fields (the default
  `serde::Serialize` derive) to hex string (`#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa`).
  Affects every type that embeds `Color` (currently `Annotation` and
  `Config::UiConfig`); downstream consumers of `serde_json` /
  `postcard` encoded `Color` values need to update.

### Notes

- Phase 0 closed against the local standing gate (`fmt`, `clippy`,
  `test`, MSRV build, cosmic build) — no git remote is configured yet,
  so the GitHub Actions pipeline has not executed against a push.
  First push will run the real CI; any failure becomes a session note.
- No released versions yet. This unreleased section tracks Phase 0
  scaffolding plus the start of Phase 1 (`config` module).

## Release cheat sheet (for maintainers)

When cutting the first release:

1. Confirm Phase exit criteria in `docs/ROADMAP.md` are met.
2. Move the `## [Unreleased]` contents to a new `## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   section.
3. Bump `version = "..."` in every `Cargo.toml` (workspace +
   per-crate).
4. Tag with `git tag -s v0.1.0`; tags are signed.
5. Publish crates in dependency order: `flintshot-core` first, then
   dependents.
6. Add a fresh `## [Unreleased]` heading above the new release.
